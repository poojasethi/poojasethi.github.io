This is a collection of my writings and musings about computer science, working in tech, growing up, building cool stuff, learning new things, making sense of the world, and figuring out what I want to do with my life. 

I'm writing this for two main reasons:

1. I like finding order in chaos. My thoughts are the chaos and my writing is (hopefully) the order.
2. I hope that you'll find some value amidst the mapping of chaos to order. If not, feel free to stop reading.

To be honest, I'm not really sure where this is going to go. But isn't there a saying that says the journey is as important, if not more important, than the end destination itself? 

Thanks for joining me on this journey. Onwards.
