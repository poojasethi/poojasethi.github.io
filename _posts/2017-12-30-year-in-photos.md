The ups and downs of 2017 in photos, because sometimes words alone don't suffice.

## January

*Getting up early in the morning to go for a run around Green Lake before class,
especially in the chilliest and wettest part of a Seattle winter, was not always
easy but always worthwhile (when I did manage to wake up, at least).
The combination of gray skies and deep breaths of dewy fresh air after it rains has
a magical way of making me feel alive.*

*January was a hard month, and I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted
for my future, since the decision for post-graduation life was near-approaching.
Running allowed me to live in the present and clear my mind.*

## February

*The best part of being a college student are the bonds you get to build with other people.
This picture was taken on the birthday of two of my best friends. It was
one of those crazy weeks in the middle of the quarter where we all had many
assignment deadlines, midterms coming up, and could have used some more sleep.*

*Despite all of that, we planned a dinner and scrambled to pick up this ice cream
cake from "un"-Safeway on the Ave; it sort of melted on the way. The great thing
about true friends is that they see you at your worst and at your best, and
still love you anyway.*

## March

*Gas Works is such a cool park because of its mix of industrial, forgotten
tanks against gentle green hills and ocean. It's almost post-apocalyptic.
Once on New Year's eve, I saw street artists juggling fire here. Another time,
my friend and I came here and we saw one of the reddest sunsets I've ever seen.
We also came up with a master plan to one day "buy" the sunset after the
IPO of our "chai dhukaan" startup ("tea shop" in Hindi), it's a bit of a long running joke...*

*There are so many memories I've made here, but let's leave at it this for now.*

## April

*I had never gone to a SASA (South Asian Student Association) / ISA (Indian Student Association)
formal the whole time I was at UW until this year, when I decided it was
something I should cross off my bucket list as a senior. Held on an Argosy cruise with
a view of the Seattle skyline, this was a night of Bollywood music and dancing
at its best. Afterwards, we hungrily devoured Greek fries on the Ave.*

## May

*This was a very emotional pre-graduation ceremony, held for the senior
undergrad women of the UW Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) department. The amazing
advisors of CSE planned the event, wishing us luck for our future and sharing
their parting wisdom. We took turns going around the room, and every graduating woman
gave a short impromptu speech on their experiences in CSE and what they were thankful for.
Each person was in their tears by the end of their speech.*

*I remember being the last student to give a speech. I don't think words could have
expressed how I felt, but I said something along the lines of CSE was to me
as Hogwarts was to Harry Potter. It was like home.*
