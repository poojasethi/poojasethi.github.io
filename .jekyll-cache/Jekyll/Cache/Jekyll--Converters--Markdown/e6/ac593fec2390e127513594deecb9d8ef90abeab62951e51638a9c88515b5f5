<p>This is a collection of my writings and musings about computer science, working in tech, growing up, building cool stuff, learning new things, making sense of the world, and figuring out what I want to do with my life.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m writing this for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I like finding order in chaos. My thoughts are the chaos and my writing is (hopefully) the order.</li>
  <li>I hope that youâ€™ll find some value amidst the mapping of chaos to order. If not, feel free to stop reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>To be honest, Iâ€™m not really sure where this is going to go. But isnâ€™t there a saying that says the journey is as important, if not more important, than the end destination itself?</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me on this journey. Onwards.</p>
